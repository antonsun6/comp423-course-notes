This approach is useful when you want to distribute or repeatedly run a compiled binary.</p> <p>When you run the <code>go run</code> command, Go first compiles your code into an executable and then immediately executes it. In contrast, the <code>go build</code> command functions similarly to how <code>gcc</code> works in C.
